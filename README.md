# Hanayo

Hanayo answers the question: what if you wanted to write in PHP but make it fast?

This is Ripple's shitty frontend. It doesn't look shitty, but the code is. There were many mistakes done in the building of Hanayo, and it is now pretty much an unmanageable beast. Do not take the code you see here as an example of good Go code.

# Its RippleÂ´s shitty fronted with Changes ;-;
